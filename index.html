<p>I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley studying nuclear engineering. Since the summer of 2020, I have been working with the low energy nuclear structure group under Dr. Heather Crawford at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. My research involves gamma-ray spectroscopyâ€”the study of the distinct energies of photons, or light particles, emitted from nuclei as they transition to a lower energy state. With the gamma-ray energies measured in our experiments, we can learn about the structure of the decaying nuclei and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of systems of nucleons. </p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
